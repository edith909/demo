-- CREATE SAMPLE TABLES

CREATE TABLE Department (
    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Employee (

-- PART 1: SIMPLE SUBQUERIES (NON-CORRELATED)
-- ============================================

-- 1. Single-row subquery ( = )
-- Employees who earn more than the average salary of ALL employees
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, salary
FROM Employee
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employee
);

-- 2. Single-row subquery with MAX()
-- Employee(s) having the maximum salary
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, salary
FROM Employee
WHERE salary = (
    SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee
);

-- 3. Multi-row subquery using IN
-- Employees working in departments located in a given set
-- Here: employees whose dept_id is in departments having "IT" or "Computer"
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employee
WHERE dept_id IN (
    SELECT dept_id
    FROM Department
    WHERE dept_name IN ('IT', 'Computer')
);

-- 4. Subquery using ANY
-- Employees whose salary is greater than ANY salary of employees in HR department
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, salary
FROM Employee
WHERE salary > ANY (
    SELECT salary FROM Employee WHERE dept_id = 30
);

-- 5. Subquery using ALL
-- Employees whose salary is greater than ALL salaries in HR department
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, salary
FROM Employee
WHERE salary > ALL (
    SELECT salary FROM Employee WHERE dept_id = 30
);

-- 6. Subquery in FROM clause (inline view)
-- Find average salary per department using subquery as a derived table
SELECT d.dept_name, t.avg_salary
FROM (
    SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY dept_id
) AS t
INNER JOIN Department d ON d.dept_id = t.dept_id;

-- 7. Subquery in SELECT clause (scalar subquery)
-- Show employee with their department name using subquery
SELECT 
    e.emp_id,
    e.emp_name,
    e.salary,
    (SELECT dept_name FROM Department d WHERE d.dept_id = e.dept_id) AS department_name
FROM Employee e;

-- ============================================
-- PART 2: CORRELATED SUBQUERIES
-- (Subquery depends on outer query row)
-- ============================================

-- 8. Correlated subquery: employee whose salary >
--    average salary of their own department
SELECT e.emp_id, e.emp_name, e.dept_id, e.salary
FROM Employee e
WHERE e.salary > (
    SELECT AVG(e2.salary)
    FROM Employee e2
    WHERE e2.dept_id = e.dept_id
);

-- 9. Correlated subquery with EXISTS
-- Departments that have at least one employee
SELECT d.dept_id, d.dept_name
FROM Department d
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Employee e
    WHERE e.dept_id = d.dept_id
);

-- 10. Correlated subquery with NOT EXISTS
-- Departments that have NO employees
SELECT d.dept_id, d.dept_name
FROM Department d
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Employee e
    WHERE e.dept_id = d.dept_id
);

-- 11. Correlated subquery: find highest paid employee
-- in each department
SELECT e.emp_id, e.emp_name, e.dept_id, e.salary
FROM Employee e
WHERE e.salary = (
    SELECT MAX(e2.salary)
    FROM Employee e2
    WHERE e2.dept_id = e.dept_id
);

-- 12. Correlated subquery with city condition
-- Employees whose salary is greater than
-- average salary of employees in SAME CITY
SELECT e.emp_id, e.emp_name, e.city, e.salary
FROM Employee e
WHERE e.salary > (
    SELECT AVG(e2.salary)
    FROM Employee e2
    WHERE e2.city = e.city
);

-- 13. Correlated subquery used like filtering
-- Employees who are NOT highest paid in their department
SELECT e.emp_id, e.emp_name, e.dept_id, e.salary
FROM Employee e
WHERE e.salary < (
    SELECT MAX(e2.salary)
    FROM Employee e2
    WHERE e2.dept_id = e.dept_id
);
